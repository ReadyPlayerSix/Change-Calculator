# Web102 - Change Calculator

## Overview
At the last minute, you've been asked to work on team developing a module for an automated check-out system of a nationally-based grocery store chain. The module your team is building will accept two inputs: the total amount of the sale and the amount tendered by the customer. Then, it should calculate the amount of change due in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

## Notes
- Discovered that the node_options had to be removed if the project were to be tested using VS Code's integrated terminal.
